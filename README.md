# Arduino_based_Ping_Pong_game
Remmeber i wrote this code way back, and it is not programmed beautifully and has huge scope of optimisation ...my Apologies ! <br />
This game uses an 8X8 DotMatrix for Display <br />
Two Potentiometers for Wedge control <br />
Arduino as microcontroller <br />
It is ping pong game <br />
Which uses two wedges to hit the ball on each side <br />
Game is for two players <br />
And if one is hitting a ball with moving wedge then ball also changes direction corresponding to wedge movements <br />
User can configure the speed of ball <br />
